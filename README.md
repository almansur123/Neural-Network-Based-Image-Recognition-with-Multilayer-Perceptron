# Neural-Network-Based-Image-Recognition-with-Multilayer-Perceptron

This project implements a binary image classification model to distinguish cats from non-cats using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The dataset contains 209 RGB images of size 64Ã—64 pixels, flattened into 4096-feature vectors. The neural network consists of an input layer with 4096 neurons, one hidden layer with 16 ReLU-activated neurons, and an output layer with a sigmoid neuron for binary classification. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 over 1000 epochs. Training resulted in a final loss of 0.0023 and a validation accuracy of 54.76%. While the MLP provides a baseline, future improvements could include convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy in image classification tasks.
